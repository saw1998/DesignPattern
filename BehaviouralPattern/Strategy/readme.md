1. Understanding Strategy Pattern
Definition
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable at runtime.

Purpose

Avoids using if-else or switch statements for selecting behavior.

Promotes Open/Closed Principle — you can add new strategies without modifying existing code.

Real-world analogy

Think of a navigation app: you can choose "Drive", "Walk", or "Bike" — each is a different route calculation strategy.
